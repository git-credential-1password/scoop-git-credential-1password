# 1Password Git Credential Helper - Scoop bucket

See https://github.com/git-credential-1password/git-credential-1password for detail.

## Installation

Run

```powershell
scoop bucket add git-credential-1password `
	https://github.com/git-credential-1password/scoop-git-credential-1password.git
scoop install git-credential-1password
```

Tips - if, for any reason, you are unable to run `scoop` commands, like `scoop update`, etc., in PowerShell or Command Prompt due to process/policy restriction. You may try running these commands in Git Bash instead.
